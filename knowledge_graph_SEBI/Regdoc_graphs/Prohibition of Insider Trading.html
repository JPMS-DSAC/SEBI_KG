Such  a  period  is  considered  reasonably  long  for  unpublished price  sensitive  information  that  is  in  possession  of  the  insider  when  formulating  the trading  plan,  to  become  generally  available.    It  is  also  considered  to  be  a  reasonable period for a time lag in which new unpublished price sensitive information may come into being  without  adversely  affecting  the  trading  plan  formulated  earlier.  In  any  case,  it should  be  remembered  that  this  is  only  a  statutory  cool-off  period  and would  not  grant immunity  from  action  if  the  insider  were  to  be  in  possession  of  the  same  unpublished price sensitive information both at the time of formulation of the plan and implementation of the same. (ii) not entail trading for the period between the twentieth trading day prior to the last day of any financial period for which results are required to be announced by the issuer of the securities and the second trading day after the disclosure of such financial results; Since the trading plan is envisaged to be an exception to the general rule prohibiting  trading  by  insiders  when  in  possession  of  unpublished  price  sensitive information, it is important that the trading plan does not entail trading for a reasonable period  around  the  declaration  of  financial  results  as  that  would  generate  unpublished price sensitive information. (iii) entail trading for a period of not less than twelve months; It is intended that it would be undesirable to have frequent announcements of  trading  plans  for  short  periods  of  time  rendering  meaningless  the  defence  of  a reasonable time gap between the decision to trade and the actual trade.  Hence it is felt that a reasonable time would be twelve months. (iv) not  entail  overlap  of  any  period  for  which  another  trading  plan  is  already  in existence; It is intended that it would be undesirable to  have multiple trading plans operating during the same time period.  Since it would be possible for an insider to time the  publication  of  the  unpublished  price  sensitive  information  to  make  it  generally available  instead  of  timing  the  trades,  it  is  important  not  to  have  the  ability  to  initiate more than one plan covering the same time period.

The nature of the trades entailed in the trading plan i.e. acquisition  or  disposal  should  be  set  out.  The  trading  plan  may  set  out  the  value  of securities or the number of securities to be invested or divested.  Specific dates or specific time intervals may be set out in the plan.

Such  a  period  is  considered  reasonably  long  for  unpublished price  sensitive  information  that  is  in  possession  of  the  insider  when  formulating  the trading  plan,  to  become  generally  available.    It  is  also  considered  to  be  a  reasonable period for a time lag in which new unpublished price sensitive information may come into being  without  adversely  affecting  the  trading  plan  formulated  earlier.  In  any  case,  it should  be  remembered  that  this  is  only  a  statutory  cool-off  period  and would  not  grant immunity  from  action  if  the  insider  were  to  be  in  possession  of  the  same  unpublished price sensitive information both at the time of formulation of the plan and implementation of the same.

(iii) entail trading for a period of not less than twelve months; It is intended that it would be undesirable to have frequent announcements of  trading  plans  for  short  periods  of  time  rendering  meaningless  the  defence  of  a reasonable time gap between the decision to trade and the actual trade.  Hence it is felt that a reasonable time would be twelve months. (iv) not  entail  overlap  of  any  period  for  which  another  trading  plan  is  already  in existence; It is intended that it would be undesirable to  have multiple trading plans operating during the same time period.  Since it would be possible for an insider to time the  publication  of  the  unpublished  price  sensitive  information  to  make  it  generally available  instead  of  timing  the  trades,  it  is  important  not  to  have  the  ability  to  initiate more than one plan covering the same time period.

The nature of the trades entailed in the trading plan i.e. acquisition  or  disposal  should  be  set  out.  The  trading  plan  may  set  out  the  value  of securities or the number of securities to be invested or divested.  Specific dates or specific time intervals may be set out in the plan.

For instance, in  the event of manipulative timing  of  the  release  of  unpublished  price  sensitive  information  to  ensure  that  trading under a trading plan becomes lucrative in circumvention of regulation 4 being detected, it  would  be  open  to  initiate  proceedings  for  alleged  breach  of  SEBI  (Prohibition  of Fraudulent  and  Unfair  Trade  Practices  Relating  to  the  Securities  Market)  Regulations,"}, {"color": "green", "from": "3.

It is intended that since the trading plan is an exception to the general rule that an insider should not trade when in possession of unpublished price sensitive information, changing the  plan  or  trading  outside  the  same  would  negate  the  intent  behind  the  exception.    Other investors  in  the  market,  too,  would  factor  the  impact  of  the  trading  plan  on  their  own  trading decisions  and  in  price  discovery.    Therefore,  it  is  not  fair  or  desirable  to permit  the  insider  to deviate from the trading plan based on which others in the market have assessed their views on the securities.

Such  a  period  is  considered  reasonably  long  for  unpublished price  sensitive  information  that  is  in  possession  of  the  insider  when  formulating  the trading  plan,  to  become  generally  available.    It  is  also  considered  to  be  a  reasonable period for a time lag in which new unpublished price sensitive information may come into being  without  adversely  affecting  the  trading  plan  formulated  earlier.

(iii) entail trading for a period of not less than twelve months; It is intended that it would be undesirable to have frequent announcements of  trading  plans  for  short  periods  of  time  rendering  meaningless  the  defence  of  a reasonable time gap between the decision to trade and the actual trade.  Hence it is felt that a reasonable time would be twelve months. (iv) not  entail  overlap  of  any  period  for  which  another  trading  plan  is  already  in existence; It is intended that it would be undesirable to  have multiple trading plans operating during the same time period.  Since it would be possible for an insider to time the  publication  of  the  unpublished  price  sensitive  information  to  make  it  generally available  instead  of  timing  the  trades,  it  is  important  not  to  have  the  ability  to  initiate more than one plan covering the same time period.

By doing so, the possession of unpublished price sensitive information when a trade under a  trading plan is actually executed would  not  prohibit  the  execution  of  such  trades  that  he  had  pre-decided  even  before  the unpublished price sensitive information came into being."}, {"color": "green", "from": "15[(5)  The  board  of  directors  or  head(s)  of  the  organisation  of  every  person  required  to  handle unpublished  price  sensitive  information  shall  ensure  that  a  structured  digital  database  is shared  under  this  regulation  along with the Permanent Account Number or any other identifier authorized by law where Permanent Account maintained  containing  the  nature  of  unpublished  price  sensitive  information  and  the  names  of such persons who have  shared the information  and also  the names of such persons with  whom information  is  shared  under  this  regulation  along  with  the  Permanent  Account  Number  or  any other  identifier  authorized  by  law  where  Permanent  Account  Number  is  not  available.

Such  a  period  is  considered  reasonably  long  for  unpublished price  sensitive  information  that  is  in  possession  of  the  insider  when  formulating  the trading  plan,  to  become  generally  available.    It  is  also  considered  to  be  a  reasonable period for a time lag in which new unpublished price sensitive information may come into being  without  adversely  affecting  the  trading  plan  formulated  earlier.  In  any  case,  it should  be  remembered  that  this  is  only  a  statutory  cool-off  period  and would  not  grant immunity  from  action  if  the  insider  were  to  be  in  possession  of  the  same  unpublished price sensitive information both at the time of formulation of the plan and implementation of the same. (ii) not entail trading for the period between the twentieth trading day prior to the last day of any financial period for which results are required to be announced by the issuer of the securities and the second trading day after the disclosure of such financial results; Since the trading plan is envisaged to be an exception to the general rule prohibiting  trading  by  insiders  when  in  possession  of  unpublished  price  sensitive information, it is important that the trading plan does not entail trading for a reasonable period  around  the  declaration  of  financial  results  as  that  would  generate  unpublished price sensitive information. (iii) entail trading for a period of not less than twelve months; It is intended that it would be undesirable to have frequent announcements of  trading  plans  for  short  periods  of  time  rendering  meaningless  the  defence  of  a reasonable time gap between the decision to trade and the actual trade.  Hence it is felt that a reasonable time would be twelve months. (iv) not  entail  overlap  of  any  period  for  which  another  trading  plan  is  already  in existence; It is intended that it would be undesirable to  have multiple trading plans operating during the same time period.  Since it would be possible for an insider to time the  publication  of  the  unpublished  price  sensitive  information  to  make  it  generally available  instead  of  timing  the  trades,  it  is  important  not  to  have  the  ability  to  initiate more than one plan covering the same time period. (v) set out either the value of trades to be effected or the number of securities to be traded  along  with  the  nature  of  the  trade  and  the  intervals  at,  or  dates  on  which  such trades shall be effected; and It  is  intended  that  while  regulations  should  not  be  too  prescriptive  and rigid  about  what  a  trading  plan  should  entail,  they  should  stipulate  certain  basic parameters  that  a  trading  plan  should  conform  to  and  within  which,  the  plan  may  be formulated with full flexibility.  The nature of the trades entailed in the trading plan i.e. acquisition  or  disposal  should  be  set  out.  The  trading  plan  may  set  out  the  value  of securities or the number of securities to be invested or divested.  Specific dates or specific time intervals may be set out in the plan. (vi) not entail trading in securities for market abuse. from bringing proceedings  for  market abuse. For instance, in  the event of manipulative timing  of  the  release  of  unpublished  price  sensitive  information  to  ensure  that  trading under a trading plan becomes lucrative in circumvention of regulation 4 being detected, it  would  be  open  to  initiate  proceedings  for  alleged  breach  of  SEBI  (Prohibition  of Fraudulent  and  Unfair  Trade  Practices  Relating  to  the  Securities  Market)  Regulations,"}, {"color": "green", "from": "15[(5)  The  board  of  directors  or  head(s)  of  the  organisation  of  every  person  required  to  handle unpublished  price  sensitive  information  shall  ensure  that  a  structured  digital  database  is shared  under  this  regulation  along with the Permanent Account Number or any other identifier authorized by law where Permanent Account maintained  containing  the  nature  of  unpublished  price  sensitive  information  and  the  names  of such persons who have  shared the information  and also  the names of such persons with  whom information  is  shared  under  this  regulation  along  with  the  Permanent  Account  Number  or  any other  identifier  authorized  by  law  where  Permanent  Account  Number  is  not  available.

It is intended that since the trading plan is an exception to the general rule that an insider should not trade when in possession of unpublished price sensitive information, changing the  plan  or  trading  outside  the  same  would  negate  the  intent  behind  the  exception.    Other investors  in  the  market,  too,  would  factor  the  impact  of  the  trading  plan  on  their  own  trading decisions  and  in  price  discovery.    Therefore,  it  is  not  fair  or  desirable  to permit  the  insider  to deviate from the trading plan based on which others in the market have assessed their views on the securities.

Such  a  period  is  considered  reasonably  long  for  unpublished price  sensitive  information  that  is  in  possession  of  the  insider  when  formulating  the trading  plan,  to  become  generally  available.    It  is  also  considered  to  be  a  reasonable period for a time lag in which new unpublished price sensitive information may come into being  without  adversely  affecting  the  trading  plan  formulated  earlier.  In  any  case,  it should  be  remembered  that  this  is  only  a  statutory  cool-off  period  and would  not  grant immunity  from  action  if  the  insider  were  to  be  in  possession  of  the  same  unpublished price sensitive information both at the time of formulation of the plan and implementation of the same. (ii) not entail trading for the period between the twentieth trading day prior to the last day of any financial period for which results are required to be announced by the issuer of the securities and the second trading day after the disclosure of such financial results; Since the trading plan is envisaged to be an exception to the general rule prohibiting  trading  by  insiders  when  in  possession  of  unpublished  price  sensitive information, it is important that the trading plan does not entail trading for a reasonable period  around  the  declaration  of  financial  results  as  that  would  generate  unpublished price sensitive information. (iii) entail trading for a period of not less than twelve months; It is intended that it would be undesirable to have frequent announcements of  trading  plans  for  short  periods  of  time  rendering  meaningless  the  defence  of  a reasonable time gap between the decision to trade and the actual trade.  Hence it is felt that a reasonable time would be twelve months. (iv) not  entail  overlap  of  any  period  for  which  another  trading  plan  is  already  in existence; It is intended that it would be undesirable to  have multiple trading plans operating during the same time period.  Since it would be possible for an insider to time the  publication  of  the  unpublished  price  sensitive  information  to  make  it  generally available  instead  of  timing  the  trades,  it  is  important  not  to  have  the  ability  to  initiate more than one plan covering the same time period. (v) set out either the value of trades to be effected or the number of securities to be traded  along  with  the  nature  of  the  trade  and  the  intervals  at,  or  dates  on  which  such trades shall be effected; and It  is  intended  that  while  regulations  should  not  be  too  prescriptive  and rigid  about  what  a  trading  plan  should  entail,  they  should  stipulate  certain  basic parameters  that  a  trading  plan  should  conform  to  and  within  which,  the  plan  may  be formulated with full flexibility.  The nature of the trades entailed in the trading plan i.e. acquisition  or  disposal  should  be  set  out.

Such  a  period  is  considered  reasonably  long  for  unpublished price  sensitive  information  that  is  in  possession  of  the  insider  when  formulating  the trading  plan,  to  become  generally  available.    It  is  also  considered  to  be  a  reasonable period for a time lag in which new unpublished price sensitive information may come into being  without  adversely  affecting  the  trading  plan  formulated  earlier.  In  any  case,  it should  be  remembered  that  this  is  only  a  statutory  cool-off  period  and would  not  grant immunity  from  action  if  the  insider  were  to  be  in  possession  of  the  same  unpublished price sensitive information both at the time of formulation of the plan and implementation of the same. (ii) not entail trading for the period between the twentieth trading day prior to the last day of any financial period for which results are required to be announced by the issuer of the securities and the second trading day after the disclosure of such financial results; Since the trading plan is envisaged to be an exception to the general rule prohibiting  trading  by  insiders  when  in  possession  of  unpublished  price  sensitive information, it is important that the trading plan does not entail trading for a reasonable period  around  the  declaration  of  financial  results  as  that  would  generate  unpublished price sensitive information. (iii) entail trading for a period of not less than twelve months; It is intended that it would be undesirable to have frequent announcements of  trading  plans  for  short  periods  of  time  rendering  meaningless  the  defence  of  a reasonable time gap between the decision to trade and the actual trade.  Hence it is felt that a reasonable time would be twelve months. (iv) not  entail  overlap  of  any  period  for  which  another  trading  plan  is  already  in existence; It is intended that it would be undesirable to  have multiple trading plans operating during the same time period.  Since it would be possible for an insider to time the  publication  of  the  unpublished  price  sensitive  information  to  make  it  generally available  instead  of  timing  the  trades,  it  is  important  not  to  have  the  ability  to  initiate more than one plan covering the same time period. (v) set out either the value of trades to be effected or the number of securities to be traded  along  with  the  nature  of  the  trade  and  the  intervals  at,  or  dates  on  which  such trades shall be effected; and It  is  intended  that  while  regulations  should  not  be  too  prescriptive  and rigid  about  what  a  trading  plan  should  entail,  they  should  stipulate  certain  basic parameters  that  a  trading  plan  should  conform  to  and  within  which,  the  plan  may  be formulated with full flexibility.  The nature of the trades entailed in the trading plan i.e. acquisition  or  disposal  should  be  set  out.  The  trading  plan  may  set  out  the  value  of securities or the number of securities to be invested or divested.  Specific dates or specific time intervals may be set out in the plan. (vi) not entail trading in securities for market abuse. from bringing proceedings  for  market abuse. For instance, in  the event of manipulative timing  of  the  release  of  unpublished  price  sensitive  information  to  ensure  that  trading under a trading plan becomes lucrative in circumvention of regulation 4 being detected, it  would  be  open  to  initiate  proceedings  for  alleged  breach  of  SEBI  (Prohibition  of Fraudulent  and  Unfair  Trade  Practices  Relating  to  the  Securities  Market)  Regulations,"}, {"color": "green", "from": "(2) In the case of connected persons the onus of establishing, that they were not in possession of  unpublished  price  sensitive  information,  shall  be  on  such  connected  persons  and  in  other cases, the onus would be on the Board.", "length": 400, "title": "Shared topics", "to": "2003.

It is intended that since the trading plan is an exception to the general rule that an insider should not trade when in possession of unpublished price sensitive information, changing the  plan  or  trading  outside  the  same  would  negate  the  intent  behind  the  exception.    Other investors  in  the  market,  too,  would  factor  the  impact  of  the  trading  plan  on  their  own  trading decisions  and  in  price  discovery.    Therefore,  it  is  not  fair  or  desirable  to permit  the  insider  to deviate from the trading plan based on which others in the market have assessed their views on the securities.

In  such  a  situation, commencement of the plan would conflict with the over-riding principle that trades should not be executed  when  in  possession  of  such  information.

Such  a  period  is  considered  reasonably  long  for  unpublished price  sensitive  information  that  is  in  possession  of  the  insider  when  formulating  the trading  plan,  to  become  generally  available.    It  is  also  considered  to  be  a  reasonable period for a time lag in which new unpublished price sensitive information may come into being  without  adversely  affecting  the  trading  plan  formulated  earlier.  In  any  case,  it should  be  remembered  that  this  is  only  a  statutory  cool-off  period  and would  not  grant immunity  from  action  if  the  insider  were  to  be  in  possession  of  the  same  unpublished price sensitive information both at the time of formulation of the plan and implementation of the same. (ii) not entail trading for the period between the twentieth trading day prior to the last day of any financial period for which results are required to be announced by the issuer of the securities and the second trading day after the disclosure of such financial results; Since the trading plan is envisaged to be an exception to the general rule prohibiting  trading  by  insiders  when  in  possession  of  unpublished  price  sensitive information, it is important that the trading plan does not entail trading for a reasonable period  around  the  declaration  of  financial  results  as  that  would  generate  unpublished price sensitive information. (iii) entail trading for a period of not less than twelve months; It is intended that it would be undesirable to have frequent announcements of  trading  plans  for  short  periods  of  time  rendering  meaningless  the  defence  of  a reasonable time gap between the decision to trade and the actual trade.  Hence it is felt that a reasonable time would be twelve months. (iv) not  entail  overlap  of  any  period  for  which  another  trading  plan  is  already  in existence; It is intended that it would be undesirable to  have multiple trading plans operating during the same time period.  Since it would be possible for an insider to time the  publication  of  the  unpublished  price  sensitive  information  to  make  it  generally available  instead  of  timing  the  trades,  it  is  important  not  to  have  the  ability  to  initiate more than one plan covering the same time period.

The nature of the trades entailed in the trading plan i.e. acquisition  or  disposal  should  be  set  out.  The  trading  plan  may  set  out  the  value  of securities or the number of securities to be invested or divested.  Specific dates or specific time intervals may be set out in the plan. (vi) not entail trading in securities for market abuse. from bringing proceedings  for  market abuse. For instance, in  the event of manipulative timing  of  the  release  of  unpublished  price  sensitive  information  to  ensure  that  trading under a trading plan becomes lucrative in circumvention of regulation 4 being detected, it  would  be  open  to  initiate  proceedings  for  alleged  breach  of  SEBI  (Prohibition  of Fraudulent  and  Unfair  Trade  Practices  Relating  to  the  Securities  Market)  Regulations,", "length": 400, "title": " possession transaction price information sevasi", "to": "f50f4e6d526f23831f43ed7cf4b38cbe.docx"}, {"color": "#000000", "from": "(4) The  trading  plan  once  approved  shall  be  irrevocable  and  the  insider  shall  mandatorily have  to  implement  the  plan,  without  being  entitled  to  either  deviate  from  it  or  to  execute  any trade in the securities outside the scope of the trading plan. Provided that the implementation of the trading plan shall not be commenced if any unpublished price sensitive information in possession of the insider at the time of formulation of the plan has not become generally available at the time of the commencement of implementation and in such event  the  compliance  officer  shall  confirm  that  the  commencement  ought  to  be  deferred  until such  unpublished  price  sensitive  information  becomes  generally  available  information  so  as  to avoid a violation of sub-regulation (1) of regulation 4. It is intended that since the trading plan is an exception to the general rule that an insider should not trade when in possession of unpublished price sensitive information, changing the  plan  or  trading  outside  the  same  would  negate  the  intent  behind  the  exception.    Other investors  in  the  market,  too,  would  factor  the  impact  of  the  trading  plan  on  their  own  trading decisions  and  in  price  discovery.    Therefore,  it  is  not  fair  or  desirable  to permit  the  insider  to deviate from the trading plan based on which others in the market have assessed their views on the securities.
